# Aegis Protocol - MCP+ Standardized Tool-Use

The Aegis protocol extends the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide:
1. **Auditability:** Every tool call is hashed and recorded.
2. **Deterministic Execution:** Strict validation of tool inputs and outputs.
3. **On-Chain Handshakes:** Agents must verify identity before exchanging data.
